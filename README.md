# F&C (Work in Progress)
### Fancy | Fans & Collectibles

## Project Overview
Creation of a decentralized platform where artists can tokenize their musical works and allow fans to purchase royalty shares. Using the Solana blockchain, smart contracts, and a website (or a Telegram bot) for user interaction.  

This project aims to allow artists to tokenize their musical works and sell royalty shares in the form of tokens on the Solana blockchain.
